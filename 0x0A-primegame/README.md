### Prime Game Code

This code implements a competitive game called the Prime Game, where players Maria and Ben compete against each other to remove prime numbers from a given list of integers. The README provides insights into prime numbers, efficient algorithms for identifying them, game theory principles, and Python programming concepts relevant to understanding and optimizing the Prime Game implementation.

# Prime Numbers

## Introduction

Prime numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics, being natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. They play a crucial role in various areas of mathematics, cryptography, and computer science. Understanding prime numbers and efficient algorithms for identifying them is essential for many computational tasks.

## Efficient Algorithms for Identifying Prime Numbers

### Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient yet highly efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2, and it continues until the square of the prime exceeds the given limit. This algorithm is particularly useful for tasks that involve identifying prime numbers within a range efficiently.

## Game Theory

Understanding basic principles of game theory is crucial for analyzing competitive games like the Prime Game. In such games, players take turns, and each player aims to optimize their moves to achieve victory. Key concepts include understanding win conditions, strategies for achieving victory, and optimal play.

## Dynamic Programming/Memoization

Dynamic Programming and Memoization are techniques used to optimize computational tasks by storing and reusing intermediate results. In the context of the Prime Game, these techniques could be utilized to improve the efficiency of calculations, especially when dealing with multiple rounds of the game.

## Python Programming

Python provides powerful features and data structures that are well-suited for implementing game logic and algorithms. Key programming concepts involved in implementing the Prime Game include loops, conditional statements, arrays, and lists for storing integers and tracking removed numbers.
